#### War of the Walkers Mod Server Side Mod W/ BBM v5.2.2

This is a copy of the official War of the Walkers Mod w/ BBM. There are a few adjustments that have been made:
- Backpack size has been adjusted on death so all items can fit.
- Added vehicle respawning to keep players from wiping vehicles off the map, this is on a 7 days timer (can be adjusted).
- Added above-ground boulder respawning for all biomes, this is on a 7 days timer (this can also be adjusted).

Thanks to dwallorde for an awesome mod and the many people who have posted their ideas on the 7 Days to Die Forums.
